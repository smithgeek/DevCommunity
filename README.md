DevCommunity
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brentosmith/DevCommunity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brentosmith/DevCommunity)

Prerequisites
============
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) must be installed

Installation and Configuration
============
Once you have project cloned open a command prompt at the DevCommunity directory.   Then install of the dependencies using npm. 
```javascript
npm install
```

The next thing you need to do is set up the configuration file.  A config-example.js file exists in the repo and you just need to rename that to config.js.  Then adjust all of the options to suit your needs.

Once you get through all that it should be ready to go and you can start the node server by going back to the command prompt and running
```javascript
node server.js
```
